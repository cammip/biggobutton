# biggobutton
- Create an app that consists of nothing but a giant button filling the screen
- The entire screen should consist of a single pushbutton, labeled "Push Me!"
- The button should also have a green background, red text, the button text should be 40dp in size and italicized
- When I push the "Push Me!" button:
  *1st time: the text should change to read "You have pushed me 1 time!"
  *Each time after that: the counter in the text should increment by 1
  *The text should read "You have pushed me 2 times!" "... 3 times!" and so on
  *The background color should change to a random color
  *The text color should randomly change, too
